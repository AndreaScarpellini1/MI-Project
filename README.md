## Project Description

The Medical Images project focuses on the processing and analysis of MRI data. The project includes MATLAB scripts to enhance, filter, and analyze images, with techniques such as Gaussian filtering, histogram equalization, and segmentation.

## Key Features

- **Image Enhancement:** Techniques such as histogram equalization and contrast adjustment.
- **Image Filtering:** Application of Gaussian, median, and other filters.
- **Image Segmentation:** ROI extraction and thresholding.
- **Visualization:** Generation of intensity histograms and segmented images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- MATLAB (version R2020b or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreaScarpellini1/MI-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd MI-Project
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

To process the MRI data:

1. Open the MATLAB scripts located in the repository.
2. Run the script corresponding to the analysis you want to perform:

   ```matlab
   run('ProjectMI_team25.m')
   ```

### Viewing the Results

The scripts will generate various images and plots, which can be viewed directly in MATLAB.

## Results

The results section includes:

- **Filtered Images:** Visualization of images processed with different filters.
- **Segmented Images:** ROI extraction and segmentation results.
- **Histograms:** Intensity histograms for different image regions.
